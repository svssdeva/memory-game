## Introduction
This project is a simple card matching game. The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

Added javascript functionality to the cards present in the deck. Whenever a closed card is clicked it opens up and player has to click on another card to check the matching. if cards are matched they remain open and background color of cards change to green. Whenever cards don't match they turn red and flip over again. Added animation to each state. Moves are counted and a rating is given on the basis of moves made by the player.

This project was a part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Program.
